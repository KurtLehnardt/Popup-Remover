# Modal Remover

## This removes all sorts of annoying overlays in chrome. My favorite is when I'm hopping around accounts on AWS and this removes the "You have signed into another account. Reload to continue" screen blocking modal, allowing me to see what I was working on before switching accounts. 

### Simple chrome extension that removes annoying, screen-blocking modals that force users to sign up, disable ad-block or join a newsletter.
### It's been updated to work with weather.com, imgur.com, standard.net, and nytimes.com. Other sites may or may not get fixed. Repeatedly clicking the extension will remove the foremost element in the page. Reload if you go too deep down the rabbit hole.
#### Please suggest any other sites you'd like to be fixed.
